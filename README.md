# Parallel Programming in Data Structures with OpenMP

This repository contains a series of beginner-friendly programming assignments that introduce parallelism using OpenMP in core Data Structures and Algorithms topics.

üéØ **Goal**: Help students learn to think in parallel and write scalable code alongside their DSA coursework.

üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies**:  
- Language: C++  
- API: OpenMP  
- Tool: [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)
